### Data Relationships
```
services → teams (owner)
services → sla_policies
tickets → services
tickets → sla_timers
requests → catalog_items → catalog_categories
problems → problem_tickets → tickets
changes → change_approvals
cmdb_ci → ci_relationships (self-referential)
assets → asset_assignments → profiles
```

### Performance Optimizations
- 40+ strategic indexes on foreign keys, status fields, timestamps
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Partial indexes for active records
- GIN indexes for JSONB fields
- Automatic `updated_at` triggers
